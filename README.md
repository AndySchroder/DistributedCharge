## Style Notes ##

- The code is written in Python.
- There are some formatting/style issues that could be considered non-standard.
   - Indentations utilize tabs rather than a series of spaces.
   - A tab is assumed to be equivalent to 8 characters.
   - Lines are also often times over 300 characters long, rather than 80 characters which is used by some programmers. This assumes you are using a high resolution screen.
   - Comments that are not indented with the code that they accompany are usually done so to stand out and indicate some deficiency, simplification, or assumption that could be improved.
